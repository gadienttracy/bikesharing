## Purpose
  The purpose of this analysis was to complete visualizations of a NYC bike sharing program.  These visualizations could then be used to draw conclusions about a similar program in Des Moines, IA.
## Results
### Checkout Times for Users

This visualization shows the amount of time that users checked out the ride share bike.  The most frequend ride time was about 5 minutes.

This visualization shows the time each gender checked the bike out.  Most frequently males had a trip duration of 5 minutes and females had a trip duration of 6 minutes.

### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour

This visualization is a heat map of the hours with the most frequent bike use.  Saturdays and Sundays have the most consistent use throughout the day.  However, before and after working hours have the highest density of use.

### Trips by Gender

This heatmap displays the hours of each day and the bikes most frequent use by gender.  Again, we see males are the highest users of the bikes and the same usage frequency is seen for all genders as was modeled in the "Trips by Weekday for Each Hour" visualization.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

In this visualization we can see that male subscribers are the most frequent users and they use the Citi bikes most frequently on Thursdays.

### Top Starting Location

This visualization models the most frequently used starting locations within NYC.

### Top Ending Locations

This visualization models th emost frequently used ending locations in NYC.

## Summary 
  In summary from these visualizations we can conclude that male subscribers are the most frequent users of the Citi Bike program.  They frequently ride on Thursdays and Fridays. The Citi bikes are in demand the most consistently (hour to hour) on Saturdays and Sundays, however before and after business hours is the highest demand for bikes.  Popular starting locations for the bikes are also popular ending locations, which makes sense because most customers are not riding the bikes for more than 20 minutes, suggesting they stay close to the origin of the bike while they are riding.
  
    In order to draw more information from the NYC Citi bikes data a visualization of where subscribers start and stop using their bikes as well as where customers start and stop using their bikes should be completed.  This information could help determine what types of employees like to use the bikes and help identify businesses to place bikes near for subscribers.  Additionally, having a visualization of popular locations for customers would help to identify the types of tourist attractions users like to visit and allow for correlations to be drawn between NYC tourist destinations and Des Moines tourist destinations.
